# SkyInsight Node Express API

Node Express API for [SkyInsight](https://github.com/DavidBartek/sky-insight). A custom-built Node Express API built to interface with SkyInsight's many external datasets (and a necessary workaround to work with providers which have not correctly configured CORS). Uses [Node Express](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html).
